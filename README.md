# Speech-Emotion-Recognisation-

This is a Speech Emotion Recognisation Project with Python.
We uses the 'librosa' library in python.
This is a Data Science and neural networking project .This project comprises of sound files.And there are a lot of concepts using fourier series ,Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficents,MEL scale is based on the way humans distinguish between frequencies which makes it very convenient to process sounds,Chroma is a Python module for handling colors with ease.
So this exciting project handels sound files and it determines the emotion using the frequency of sound.
fourier Series just converted the sound wave to different frequency. And it devides the sound wave to equal division to make differentiatation .
We can easily differentiate the difference between 110 Hz and 120 Hz ,But for higher frequency like 1100 Hz and 1200 Hz .It's impossible to differentiate as this frequency is out of range of our audible level.
So its a crazy data science project uses neural networking and some other interesting libraries like glob and pickle
Here is another concept like pickling and unpickling.
This just transfer the python object like: List,Tuple to byte stream and the unpickling is just opposite to pickiling.It returns array.
So guys make your Prediction and go checkout the coding.
